# ðŸ”§ Node.js Compatibility Fix

## Issue Fixed

The project was initially created with Vite v7.1.6, which requires Node.js v20.19+ or v22.12+. Since you're using Node.js v20.11.1, this caused a compatibility error.

## Solution Applied

Downgraded to compatible versions:
- **Vite**: v7.1.6 â†’ v5.4.20
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: v5.0.3 â†’ v4.3.1

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

Your development server is now running successfully at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000/
- **Network**: http://192.168.56.1:3000/

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer to keep the latest versions, you can:

### Option 1: Upgrade Node.js (Recommended for production)
```bash
# Download from https://nodejs.org/
# Install Node.js v20.19+ or v22.12+
# Then upgrade Vite back to latest:
npm install -D vite@latest @vitejs/plugin-react@latest
```

### Option 2: Keep Current Setup (Works for development)
The current configuration is perfectly functional for development and will work with all Framer integrations.

## Security Note

There are some moderate security vulnerabilities in the current esbuild version, but these are only relevant for development and don't affect the production build. If you want to address them:

```bash
npm audit fix --force
# Warning: This will upgrade to Vite v7+ and break Node.js compatibility again
```

## Verification

âœ… Development server running  
âœ… Hot module replacement working  
âœ… TypeScript compilation working  
âœ… Tailwind CSS loaded  
âœ… Framer Motion ready  
âœ… API layer configured  

Your project is ready for Framer component integration!
